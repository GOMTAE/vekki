## 1. Introduction
VeKKI began as a subsociety of [**VeKNI e.V.**](https://www.vekni.org/) (*Verein Koreanischer Naturwissenschaftler und Ingenieure in der BRD e.V.*), also known as the **Korean Scientists and Engineers Association in the FRG**. Our members consist mainly of mechanical/aerospace/robotics engineers who are actively engaged in diverse research areas.

## 2. Objectives
Our primary goals are to:
- Stay informed and engaged with the latest advancements in AI research.
- Create a platform where members can share ideas, gaining valuable motivation and inspiration.

## 3. Weekly Meetings
We hold weekly sessions lasting 30 minutes to an hour, where each member present research updates / interesting topics. Currently, we start with a group of 4 members. Schedules are managed through our [Notion]([https://](https://www.notion.so/VEKKI-13160e324e6f80d78173daa7e9a66960?cookie_sync_completed=true)) page for easy coordination.

## 4. Resources and Weekly Summaries
Any notebooks, tutorials, or other resources developed through our discussions will be shared here for group access. Each week, we’ll include a brief summary (2-3 sentences) of the topics discussed and progress made.
